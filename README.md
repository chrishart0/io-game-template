# .io-Style Game Development Roadmap

This document provides a structured guide for building a massively multiplayer .io-style game (e.g., similar to Agar.io or Slither.io). The project uses **NextJS** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express.js** and **Socket.IO** for the backend, all within a single repository. The roadmap includes a todo list, an outcome-based milestone plan, and repository context to facilitate development and collaboration.

---

## Project Overview

The goal is to create a real-time, multiplayer game with the following features:
- **Real-time Communication**: Players' actions (e.g., movement) are sent to the server and broadcast to others instantly.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle multiple simultaneous players.
- **Simple Web UI**: A minimal interface using a canvas for game rendering.
- **Ease of Setup**: A straightforward tech stack for quick development.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: NextJS (React) with `socket.io-client` for WebSocket communication.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and Socket.IO for real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **Repository Structure**: Both frontend and backend are organized in a single repo for simplicity.

---

## Repository Context

The repository is structured to keep the frontend and backend in separate directories, with a root-level `package.json` to manage both.

### Directory Structure
```
my-io-game/
├── frontend/                 # NextJS frontend
│   ├── package.json          # Frontend dependencies (NextJS, socket.io-client)
│   ├── pages/                # NextJS pages (e.g., index.js with game canvas)
│   ├── components/           # React components
│   └── ...                   # Other NextJS files (e.g., styles, public)
├── backend/                  # Node.js backend with Express.js and Socket.IO
│   ├── package.json          # Backend dependencies (express, socket.io)
│   └── index.js              # Backend server code
└── package.json              # Root package.json with scripts to manage both frontend and backend
```

### Key Files
- **`frontend/pages/index.js`**: Contains the main game component, including the canvas for rendering and WebSocket connection logic.
- **`backend/index.js`**: Sets up the Express.js server and Socket.IO for handling real-time player connections and game state updates.
- **`package.json` (root)**: Includes scripts to install dependencies and run both the frontend and backend together.

### Dependencies
- **Frontend**:
  - NextJS
  - `socket.io-client` (for WebSocket communication)
- **Backend**:
  - `express`
  - `socket.io`

### Running the Project
- **Development**:
  - Install all dependencies: `npm run install:all`
  - Start both frontend and backend: `npm run dev`
- **Production**:
  - Build the frontend: `npm run build:frontend`
  - Start the backend (which serves the frontend): `npm start`

## Todo List

This todo list breaks down the development process into actionable tasks. Each task should be checked off as it's completed.

### Frontend (NextJS)
- [X] Initialize a new NextJS project in the `frontend/` directory.
- [X] Install `socket.io-client` for WebSocket communication.
- [ ] Create a game page (`pages/index.js`) with a canvas element for rendering the game.
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection logic in the game component to connect to the backend.
- [ ] Add event listeners for player inputs (e.g., mouse movements, keyboard inputs).
- [ ] Render the game state on the canvas based on updates received from the server.

### Backend (Node.js with Express.js and Socket.IO)
- [ ] Initialize a new Node.js project in the `backend/` directory.
- [ ] Install `express` and `socket.io`.
- [ ] Set up an Express.js server in `backend/index.js`.
- [ ] Integrate Socket.IO with the server to handle WebSocket connections.
- [ ] Handle player connections and disconnections, logging them for verification.
- [ ] Implement a game loop to periodically update and broadcast the game state to all connected clients.

### Integration
- [ ] Ensure the frontend successfully connects to the backend via WebSocket.
- [ ] Send player input data (e.g., movement) from the frontend to the backend.
- [ ] Receive and process game state updates on the frontend to reflect the current game state.

### Game Logic
- [ ] Define the structure of the game state (e.g., player positions, scores, game objects).
- [ ] Implement server-side logic to update the game state based on player inputs and game rules.
- [ ] Broadcast the updated game state to all connected clients at regular intervals.

### Deployment
- [ ] Configure environment variables for production (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`, `PORT`).
- [ ] Build the NextJS frontend for production using `next build` and `next export`.
- [ ] Set up a hosting platform for the backend (e.g., Heroku, AWS EC2, or a VPS).
- [ ] Deploy the backend and ensure the frontend connects to the deployed backend URL.

## Outcome-Based Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major milestones of the project, each with a clear outcome to achieve. It helps track progress and ensures the project stays on course.

### Milestone 1: Project Setup
- **Outcome**: A basic project structure with frontend and backend directories, and a root `package.json` to manage both.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize NextJS project in `frontend/`.
  - Initialize Node.js project in `backend/`.
  - Create root `package.json` with scripts to install dependencies and run both frontend and backend.

### Milestone 2: Basic WebSocket Connection
- **Outcome**: The frontend can connect to the backend via WebSocket, and connections are logged.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement WebSocket connection logic in the frontend using `socket.io-client`.
  - Set up Socket.IO server in the backend to accept connections.
  - Log player connections and disconnections on the backend.

### Milestone 3: Player Input Handling
- **Outcome**: Players can send inputs (e.g., movement) to the server, and the server acknowledges receipt.
- **Tasks**:
  - Add event listeners for player inputs on the frontend (e.g., mouse movements).
  - Send input data to the backend via WebSocket.
  - Handle and log input events on the backend.

### Milestone 4: Game State Management
- **Outcome**: The server maintains a game state and broadcasts it to all connected clients.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define the game state structure (e.g., player positions, game objects).
  - Implement a game loop on the server to update the game state periodically.
  - Broadcast the updated game state to all connected clients.

### Milestone 5: Rendering the Game
- **Outcome**: The frontend renders the game based on the state received from the server.
- **Tasks**:
  - Receive game state updates on the frontend via WebSocket.
  - Use the canvas API to render the game state (e.g., draw players, objects).

### Milestone 6: Deployment
- **Outcome**: The game is deployed and accessible online, with the frontend served by the backend.
- **Tasks**:
  - Build the NextJS frontend for production.
  - Configure the backend to serve the static frontend files.
  - Deploy the backend to a hosting platform and update the frontend to connect to the deployed backend.

## Additional Notes for Collaboration

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in the frontend to specify the backend WebSocket URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4000` for development, or the production URL).
  - Use `PORT` in the backend to set the server port (default: 4000).

- **Development Workflow**:
  - Run `npm run dev` from the root directory to start both frontend and backend development servers.
  - The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend at `http://localhost:4000`.

- **Production Considerations**:
  - The backend serves the static frontend files from `frontend/out` after running `next build` and `next export`.
  - Ensure the hosting platform supports WebSocket connections (e.g., Heroku with WebSockets enabled).

- **Contributing**:
  - Follow the todo list and roadmap to implement features incrementally.
  - Test both frontend and backend changes thoroughly.
  - Update this document as necessary to reflect changes in the project structure or requirements.
